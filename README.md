#### The Maya plug-in is not currently compatible with Maya 2022.  We plan to update our architecture to support it but we do not yet have a schedule for the release. 

#### Upvote the feature request on our feedback site to help prioritize Maya plugin development: https://feedback.syncsketch.com/feature-requests/p/maya-plugin

The syncsketch-maya plugin which will allow you to 
- upload videos and plablasts to syncsketch in seconds, skipping any conversion process
- download notes and image annotations from syncsketch back to maya, adjust parameters such like frame offset etc
- manage your viewport presets for recording

See a quick Intro Video for this plugin here: https://vimeo.com/syncsketch/integrationmaya

#### Installing an experimental dev release:


1) Set environment variable `SS_DEV` to `dev` in your environment or Maya Script Editor

```
import os
os.environ['SS_DEV'] = 'dev'
```

2) Download [installCrossPlatform.mel-DEV](https://github.com/syncsketch/syncsketch-maya/releases/download/dev/installGui.py) and drag it into your maya-viewport.

### Manual (Experienced user)


If you are familiar with python and pip, you can go for a manual installation  and follow these steps:

1. Install the Syncsketch-API + extras
 
> `pip2.7.exe install --upgrade --user https://github.com/syncsketch/python-api/archive/v1.0.4.zip pyyaml requests[security]`

2. Install the Syncsketch-GUI
 
> `pip2.7.exe install --upgrade --target=C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\maya\2018\scripts https://github.com/syncsketch/syncsketchGUI/archive/release.zip`

3. Open Maya & Install the maya Shelf from the script editor:
> `import syncsketchGUI
syncsketchGUI.install_shelf()`

__Note__: Manual install expects you to have `ffmpeg` and `pip` already installed and set-up correctly.

### Fork and send pull request
If you want to contribute to this project, your help is very welcome. We are trying to give a minimal version of a Publish workflow, which you can either adapt or get inspired by. 


### Long: How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of our Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the to the master branch
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
